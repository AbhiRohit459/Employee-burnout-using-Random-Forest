# Employee-burnout-using-Random-Forest
Employee burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion due to excessive and prolonged stress, negatively impacting well-being and job performance. Recognizing and addressing burnout signs is crucial in today's fast-paced, connected world to maintain employee health.

This project explores using regression techniques to predict employee burnout. By analyzing factors such as workload, mental fatigue, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, we aim to develop a model to identify individuals at risk of burnout. Our goal is to create a predictive tool for organizations to proactively address these risk factors
